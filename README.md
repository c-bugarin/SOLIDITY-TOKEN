# SOLIDITY TOKEN

This is simple a creation of "SOLIDITY TOKEN". This program is indicated for you to create a token using the functionality of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

This program is a simple smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a mint and burn function that creates the token. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming and for creating a token, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future (e.g., ERC-721 NFT Token).

## Getting Started

### Installing

You can download my file here in Github (https://github.com/cthrn-b/SOLIDITY-TOKEN/tree/main)

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new workspace, after that create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.18;

contract myToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "META";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "MTA";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
   }

    // burn function
    function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {
        if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balances[_address] -= _value;
      }
   }
}
```
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy and run the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by clicking the functions. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the Deploy/Unpinned Contracts, and you can input the balances, and/or what to mint and to burn. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function or the balances you have inputted.
